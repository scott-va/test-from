        **NOTE:** Before submitting this GitHub issue form, please confirm that you meet all prerequisites outlined in our [Onboarding to DI](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/delivery-platform-docs/Getting-access/Onboarding-to-DI/#step-1-prerequisites-for-onboarding-and-provisioning-lhdi-resources) documentation.
        
        **NOTE:** If your GitHub repository(s) visibility is set to `public`, you must leverage GitHub [repository mirroring feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository-in-another-location), to create and onboard a copy of your repository, and set the visibility to `internal` within the `department-of-veterans-affairs` GitHub organization. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of our SecRel pipeline, we cannot allow public repos to call SecRel at this time.
